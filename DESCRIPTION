Description: This MouseAgingData package provides analysis-ready data
    resources from different studies focused on aging and rejuvenation in
    mice. The package includes two 10x Genomics single-cell data sets. The first
    study profiled the aging mouse brain, and contains 37089 cells and 14699 
    features (Ximerakis et al., 2019), and the second is a parabiosis 
    transcriptomic study containing 105329 cells and 20905 features 
    (Ximerakis & Holton et al., 2023). The data are provided as 
    SingleCellExperiment R objects and includes a table of raw counts and cell 
    metadata.
