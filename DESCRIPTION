Description: This MouseAgingData package provides analysis-ready data
    resources from different studies focused on aging and rejuvenation in
    mice. The package currently includes a 10X Genomics single-cell data
    sets from an aging mouse brain parabiosis transcriptomic study
    containing 105329 cells and 20905 features (Ximerakis & Holton et al.,
    2023). The data is provided as a SingleCellExperiment R object and
    includes a table of raw counts and cell metadata.
