Description: This MouseAgingData package includes analysis-ready data resource 
    of different aging omics datasets, including the aging mouse brain single 
    cell study (Ximerakis et al., 2019), aging mouse brain parabiosis single 
    cell study (Ximerakis et al., 2023). In addition, two relevant 
    transcriptomic studies of rejuvenation in the GEO database are also 
    available, including an aging mouse caloric restriction single cell study 
    (GSE137869, Ma et al., 2020), and an aging mouse exercise single cell study 
    (GSE196364, Liu et al., 2022).
