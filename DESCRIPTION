Description: This MouseAgingData package provides analysis-ready data resources 
    from different studies focused on aging and rejuvenation in mice. Studies 
    include a 10X Genomics single-cell data sets from an aging mouse brain 
    parabiosis transcriptomic study containing 105329 cells and 20905 features 
    (Ximerakis & Holton et al., 2023). The data is provided as a
    SingleCellExperiment R object and includes a table of raw counts and cell
    metadata.
