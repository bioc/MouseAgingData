Description: The MouseAgingData package provides analysis-ready data
    resources from different studies focused on aging and rejuvenation in
    mice. The package currently provides two 10x Genomics single-cell RNA-seq
    datasets. The first study profiled the aging mouse brain measured across
    37,089 cells (Ximerakis et al., 2019). The second study investigated
    parabiosis by profiling a total of 105,329 cells (Ximerakis & Holton et al., 2023).
    The datasets are provided as SingleCellExperiment objects and provide raw
    UMI counts and cell metadata.
