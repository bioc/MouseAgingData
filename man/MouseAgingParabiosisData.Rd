\title{Load mouse aging parabiosis data}
\usage{
MouseAgingParabiosisData(
  type = c("processed", "raw"),
  samples = NULL,
  get.spliced = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{String specifying the type of data to obtain, see Details.
Default behaviour is to return processed data.}

\item{samples}{Integer or character vector specifying the samples for which data (processed or raw) should be obtained.
If \code{NULL} (default), data are returned for all (36) samples.}

\item{get.spliced}{Logical indicating whether to also download the spliced/unspliced/ambiguously spliced count matrices.}
}
\value{
If \code{type="processed"}, a \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} is returned containing processed data from selected samples.

If \code{type="raw"}, a \linkS4class{List} of SingleCellExperiments is returned,
each containing the raw counts for a single sample.
List elements are named after the corresponding sample.
}
\description{
Obtain the processed or raw counts for the mouse again parabiosis 10X Genomics scRNA dataset.

\details{
This function downloads the data for the mouse aging parabiosis study from Ximerakis et al (\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00373-6}{2023}).
The raw dataset contains 158,767 cells with data for 21,876 features outputted from CellRanger for a total of 55 animals.
The processed dataset contains 105,329 cells and 20905 features for 31 cell types. Low quality cells and animals were removed following Ximerakis et al. (2023) resulting in 8 OX, 8 YX, 7 YY, 9 YO, 7 OO, 11 OY animals.

For both raw and processed data, the row metadata contains the Ensembl ID and MGI symbol for each gene. # Check this

A reminder of the heterochronic groups included in this study is available below:
Aging OX v YX; RJV: OY v OX; AGA YO v YX

\section{Metadata -----------------------------------------------------------------------------}{
The \code{parabiosis_metadata} variable contains information about each of these samples.

The column metadata for called cells contains:
\describe{
\item{\code{cell}:}{Character, unique cell identifier across all samples.}
\item{\code{orig.ident}:}{Character, origin project identifier.}
\item{\code{nCount_RNA}:}{Numeric, number of RNA transcripts.}
\item{\code{nFeature_RNA}:}{Integer, number of RNA features.}
\item{\code{sample_order}:}{Character, unique animal identifier and sequencing batch.}
\item{\code{animal}:}{Character, unique animal identifier, includes heterochronic or isochronic condition.}
\item{\code{batch}:}{Character, sequencing batch identifier.}
\item{\code{animal_name}:}{Character, isochronic or heterochronic conditions.}
\item{\code{percent.mito}:}{Numeric, percentage of mitochondrial content.}
\item{\code{percent.ribo}:}{Numeric, percentage of ribosomal content.}
\item{\code{cell_type}:}{Character, cell type to which the cell was assigned.}
\item{\code{subpopulation}:}{Character, cell subpopulation to which cell was assigned.}
}
