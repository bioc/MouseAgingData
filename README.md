# MouseAgingData

## Data resources across several mouse aging studies

The MouseAgingData package provides analysis-ready data resources from different single-cell studies focused on aging and rejuvenation in mice. Currently, the package includes a 10x Genomics single-cell RNA-seq data set from a parabiosis aging mouse brain study measuring 20,905 gene features across 105,329 cells ([Ximerakis & Holton et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-023-00373-6])). The data is provided as a [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment) R object and includes a table of raw UMI counts and cell metadata.

## Installation

Install the package from Bioconductor or GitHub, ensuring correct
*Bioconductor* dependencies.

When the package is available on *Bioconductor*, use

``` r
if (!"BiocManager" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))
    install.packages("BiocManager", repos = "https://cloud.R-project.org")
if (BiocManager::version() >= "3.19") {
    BiocManager::install("MouseAgingData")
} else {
    stop(
        "'MouseAgingData' requires Bioconductor version 3.19 or later, ",
        "install from GitHub?"
    )
}
```

Use the pre-release or development version with

``` r
if (!"remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))
    install.packages("remotes", repos = "https://cloud.R-project.org")
remotes::install_github(
    "hms-ccb/MouseAgingData",
    repos = BiocManager::repositories()
)
```

Load the library.

``` r
library(MouseAgingData)
```

## Datasets

#### 1. Ximerakis & Holton et al. 2023 Parabiosis 10x Genomics Single-cell RNA-seq data

This package contains the processed 10x Genomics single-cell RNA-seq data from 
([Ximerakis & Holton et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00373-6)).
Quality control and preprocessing were carried out as described in the Methods section of the paper. 
The processed dataset contains 
105,329 cells and 20,905 features for 31 cell types. Low quality cells and 
animals were removed following the paper's methods resulting in 8 OX, 8 YX, 
7 YY, 9 YO, 7 OO, 11 OY animals.

This package includes gene counts, cell annotation, and reduced-dimension 
representations as separate components of the processed data, that are served
in an integrated `SingleCellExperiment` object.
